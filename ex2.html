            <h2> The Photovoltaic Effect </h2>
            <p>
                Like the photoelectric electric effect, the photovoltaic effect occurs
                light causes electrons within a material to change energy states.
                In the photoelectric effect, high energy photons cause the electrons to 
                break free from the surface of the material altogether, but in the photovoltaic
                effect, the electrons only gain enough energy to jump from the valence bands to
                the conduction bands of a crystalline structure. This adds a negatively-charged
                electron carrier particle to the structure, and leaves behind a positively-charged
                carrier particle with the hole left behind. In most materials, the random thermal 
                motions of the electrons means that the electron-hole pairs will recombine quickly, 
                giving off light (as reflections) and generating no current. But there is a special case
                where it becomes more important: Doped Semiconductors.

        <div class="row section">
            <h2> P-N Junctions </h2>
            <p>
                Semiconductor technologies have made computers possible, and the fundamental
                unit of this technology is the P-N junction, often called a diode. 
                In P-N junctions, a semiconductor (usually a group 14 element like silicon) 
                that has no inherent charge is doped with other elements. In P-Type material,
                it is doped with group 13 elements (such as Boron or Gallium) that have an 
                opening in their valence band that is easily filled by an electron.
                These “acceptor” atoms capture electrons, leaving an excess of positively 
                charged holes. In N-Type material, it is doped with group 15 elements 
                (such as Phosphorus or Arsenic) that have one loosely-held electron in their 
                valence band. These “donor” atoms lose electrons easily, allowing the 
                negatively-charged particles to move about the crystalline structure in the conduction band.
            </p>
            <p> 
                When the P-Type and N-Type materials are joined at a junction, the electrons 
                in the N-Type material combine with the acceptors in the P-Type, and the holes
                in the P-Type material get filled by the donors in the N-Type. Since this 
                exchange causes the acceptor atoms to become negatively-charged and the donor 
                atoms to become positively-charged, an electric field is generated at the 
                junction in the direction from the N-Type to the P-Type. The electric field 
                drives out any carrier particles out of the junction, keeping the N-Type 
                electrons from diffusing into the P-Type material, and vice versa.
            </p>
            <img class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid"" src="resources/pn_junction.png"> </img>
            <p>
                This built-in electric field is the power of the P-N junction. When a voltage
                is applied in the same direction of the electric field (from N-Type to P-Type,
                Cathode to Anode) it just strengthens this electric field barrier and resists 
                current flow like and insulator. When a strong enough voltage is applied in 
                the opposite direction (from P-Type to N-Type, from Anode to Cathode) the
                built-in electric field is overcome and current flows as if it was a normal conductor.
            </p>
            <p> 
                While this is useful in rectifying AC signals, overvoltage protection, 
                and in transistors, this P-N electric field also enables the photovoltaic
                effect. As mentioned before, when light hits the silicon material, it 
                causes electrons to jump from the valence band to the conduction band, 
                creating an electron-hole pair. While these electron-hole pairs often recombine,
                the presence of the electric field makes it much more likely that the electron
                will drift to the N-Type material, and the holes will drift to the P-Type
                material. This generates a measureable current.

            <h2> The Mathematical Models </h2>
            <p>
                This current is what might be causing the signal generation in the Light
                Commands attack, but we need to understand the mathematical relationship 
                between the light and the current being generated.
            </p>
            <h3> Band Gap</h3>
            <p> 
                First, similar to the photoelectric effect, we need to understand at which
                frequencies of light this effect occurs. The energy required to move an electron
                from the valence band to the electric band is called the Band Gap ( \(E_g \) ). For silicon
                at room temperature, the band gap is ~\(1.11 eV \)
                <a class="inline-citation" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true" title="C. Kittel, Introduction to solid state physics, 8th ed. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2005. pp. 180."> [6] </a> 
                . From the last post, we know that
                the energy of a photon is related to its frequency:
                \[ E = hf \]
                So, the minimum frequency to cause an electron to jump from the valence band to the 
                conduction band is:
                \[{ 
                    f_0 = \frac{E_{g}}{h} = \frac{1.11eV * 1.602{\times}10^{-19}J/eV}{6.626{\times}10^{-34} J{\cdot}s} \approx 268 THz 
                }\]
                which means the wavelength is:
                \[ \lambda = \frac{c}{f_0} \approx 1120 nm \]
                This wavelength is in the near-infrared spectrum, and all the 
                light frequencies used in the Light Commands attack have enough
                energy to cross the band gap.
            </p>
            <h3> Photon Flux </h3>
            <p>
                Now that we know that the frequencies we are using can cause the photovoltaic
                effect, we need to understand the relationship between light and current.
                I’m used to seeing laser light in terms of optical power ( \(P\) ). For example,
                class 1 laser pointers that are used in presentations are limited to a max
                optical power output of \( 5 mW \). In the photovoltaic effect, however, the important
                parameter is the number of photons striking the P-N junction per unit area per
                second. This is called the photon flux ( \(\phi\) ). The photon flux can be calculated
                from the optical power ( \(P\) ), the area of the laser beam ( \(A_B\) ), and the number of
                photons per unit energy. In monochromatic light, this is
                \[
                    \begin{align} 
                    & \phi = \frac{P}{A_B} \times \frac{\lambda}{hc} \\\\ 
                    & [photons/s/m^2] = \frac{[J/s]}{[m^2]} \times [photon/J] \end{align}
                \]
            </p>
            <h3> Diode Photocurrent </h3>
            <p> 
                Now that we have the photon flux, we can then move to calculate the 
                photocurrent generated. While the photon flux shows how many will
                strike the surface of the material, only a percentage of those photons
                will generate a current. This is because the random motions of the 
                electron-hole pairs and crystalline defects in the junction 
                (especially near the surface) will cause electron-hole pairs to recombine 
                rather than drift the the ends of the junction. The ratio of the number of 
                electrons that generate current to the number of photons that hit the junction
                is called the Quantum Efficiency ( \(\eta_{\lambda}\) ), and is a function of wavelength that is
                inherent to each P-N Junction.
            </p>
            <img class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid"" src="resources/QuantumEfficiency.png"> </img>
            <p>
                Since we know the fundamental charge ( \(e=1.602×10^{−19} C \) ) per electron,
                we can calculate the current density ( \(J_{\phi}\) ) generated by the laser to be:
                \[
                    \begin{align}
                        & J_{\phi} = e\eta_{\lambda}\phi \\\\
                        & [A/m^2] = [C/s/m^2] = [C/electron] \times [electrons/photon] \times [photons/s/m^2] \\\\
                        & J_{\phi} = e\eta_{\lambda}\frac{P{\lambda}}{A_Bhc} [A]
                    \end{align}
                \]
                Then finally, the photocurrent is simply the current density multiplied by the 
                cross-sectional area of the junction ( \(A_J\) ):
                \[ 
                    \begin{align}
                        & I_{\phi} = J_{\phi} * A_J \\\\
                        & [A] = [A/m^2] * [m^2]
                    \end{align}
                \]
                This brings the final photocurrent equation to: 
                \[
                    I_{\phi} = \frac{e\eta_{\lambda}}{hc}{\times}\frac{A_J{\lambda}P}{A_B} [A]
                \]
            </p>

            <h2> Discussion </h2>
            <p>
                What this equation tells us is that the current generated by the light is directly
                proportional to the optical power, which matches the roughly linear relationship
                between optical power and the signal generated in the Light Commands experiments.
                It also confirms that the focusing of the beam plays a large part, as the area
                of the beam is inversely proportional to the current. I will look at this in
                a future post, as it could mean the optics are even more important the the 
                raw power of the beam.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another factor is the wavelength. While the quantum efficiency is nonlinear
                and hard to solve mathematically, it can be approximated as a constant within
                the wavelengths we are interested in. With this assumption, the photocurrent is
                also directly proportional to wavelength, meaning that wavelengths inthe red
                and infrared will perform better than blue. This makes some intuitive sense,
                as red light contains more photons than blue light of the same optical power.
                More photons generates more electron-hole pairs, which means more current.
                The blue light photons have more energy, but that just means more energy gets
                wasted as light and heat, as you only need to cross that Band Gap of \(1.11eV\).
            </p>
            <p>
                With this knowledge, we can make a hypothesis that if the photovoltaic effect
                is the primary cause of the Light Commands effect, then longer wavelengths of
                light in the red and infrared spectrum (up to the minimum frequency required
                to cross the band gap) will perform better than blue light at the same optical power density.

            <h2> Open Questions </h2>
            <p>
                There are still some open questions and future work, however. While this describes
                how diodes will be affected by light, it leaves the question of how this relates
                to the circuit on the MEMs microphones themselves. To me, these ASICs are black boxes,
                where I can only presume certain circuit elements such as filters, amplifiers, and oscillators. 
                Transistors are also more complicated, and the photocurrent generated in transistors may be
                more difficult to model than in diodes. I’ll need to dig deeper into MEMs circuit design to
                make some hypotheses about which circuit elements would be most vulnerable.
